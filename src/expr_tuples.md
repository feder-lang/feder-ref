## Tuples

A tuple is a primary expression **(** *expr* **)**,
where at least *expr* is a binary operator **,** comma expression.

A tuple with **&** *id* or *id* as elements must be the the left
hand side of the **:=** assignment. Tuples with *vardecl* as elements
must be the left hand side of the **=** assignment. Tuples with just
types must be a function's result-type. Tuple with just values as elements
must be a the function's return-value.
