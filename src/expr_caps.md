## Capabilities

Capabilities can modify how a function is called, implemented or changes
compile time informations about an object.

**Capabilities**:

- **Unused**: Still implement semantic, even if unused

- **Inline**: Function name is removed its own environment (prevents direct
  recursion). Tells compiler to eventually directly implement function
  instead of calling it.

- **Constant**: Function can be computed at compile time. Only primitive
  datatypes can be used.

**Ensure**:

- Ensure that certain properties are valid. *id* in *ensurecond* can also be
  functions in the same class which only have the class as parameter, next
  to the attributes of the class.

- Function cannot be called if one *ensurecond* is invalid

**Ensures**:

- Ensures that after calling the function, certain properties are valid. The
  *id* **result** can be accessed to ensure that the result behaves in a
  certain way. This also can be conditional on the result, so if the 
  user ensures the *ensurecond0*, *ensurecond1* would automatically be valid.

- The ensurance is not further executed, no further deductions are made.

- The *idcall* in *ensurecond* or *ensurecond1* will be reset before ensurance
  is made. Meaning if ``connected == false`` was ensured and
  ``#!ensure connected == true`` is called, ``connected == false`` will no
  longer be valid.

Example:

```
class Client(_addr : Address)
    _nativeConn : Option{NativeClientConnection}

    #!ensure connected == false
    func _init
        _nativeConn = Option{NativeClientConnection}.None()
    ;

    #!ensures result == false => _nativeConn == Option.None
    #!ensures result == true => _nativeConn == Option.Some
    func connected(This) : bool
        match _nativeConn
            Some(_) => return true ;
            _ => return false ;
        ;
    ;

    #!ensure connected == false
    #!ensures result == true => connected == true
    #!ensures result == false => connected == false
    func connect(This) : bool
        _nativeConn = createNativeClientConnection(_addr)
        match _nativeConn
            Some(_) => return true ;
            _ => return false ;
        ;
    ;

    #!ensure connected == true
    #!ensures connected == false
    func disconnect
        Option.Some(conn) = _nativeConn
        conn.disconnect()
    ;

    #!ensure connected == true
    func send(This, msg : Array{u8})
        Option.Some(conn) = _nativeConn
        conn.send(msg)
    ;

    #!ensure connected == true
    func receive(This, msg : Array{u8})
        Option.Some(conn) = _nativeConn
        conn.send(msg)
    ;
;

func main
    client := Client(Address("127.0.0.1", 22))
    ensure client.connect()
        std.io.out << "Connected to server" << std.io.endl
        client.send("help the world")
        client.disconnect()
        // client.send, receive no longer callable
    else
        // client.send, receive cannot be called here
        // as ensure connected == true is invalid
        std.io.out << "Connection failure" << std.io.endl
    ;
;
```
