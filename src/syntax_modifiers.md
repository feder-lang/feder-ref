## Identifier modifiers

Starting an identifier with a underscore '_', makes the semantic private.
Starting with an identifier with an uppercase or the second character is
uppercase, if the identifier starts with an underscore, makes the semantic
constant, of course if the semantic started with an underscore it's also
private. If all letter of the identifier are uppercase, the semantic is
immutable.
