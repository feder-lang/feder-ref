# Introduction

Feder is an imperative programming language, which focuses on runtime speed,
intuitive design and more reliable programs. As such, Feder uses a garbage
collection, looks a lot like script-like programs and doesn't have
null-pointers.

## Target audience

Targeted are those, who seek in-depth knowledge about Feder. This is by no
means a guide for beginners.

## Example program

A hello world program

```
import std.io.println

println("Hello, World!")
```

which prints

```
Hello, World!
```

to standard output.
