## Identifiers

Identifiers are character sequences for naming variables, functions,
classes, enumerations, traits and namespaces. Identifiers are represented
a sequence of the decimal digits, letters and the '\_' character.

An identifier mustn't start with a decimal digit. Also the whole sequence must
not have only '\_' as characters. After leading '\_' there mustn't be a digit.
