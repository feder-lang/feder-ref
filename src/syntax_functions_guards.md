### Guards

> *guard* := **|** *expr0* *guardresult*?\
> *guardresult* := **=>** *expr1*

Where: *expr0* is the guard condition and *expr1* the guard result.

Guards guard the function body from certain (invalid) arguments. The guard must
evaluate to the type [bool](./kernel_bool.md). The guard result will be
returned, if the guard evaluates to **True**.  If no guard result is given,
the guard will spawn a panic, if the guard evaluates to **True**. The guard
result has to evaluate to the same type as the return-type of the function. Of
course, guard results are invalid if the function has no return type.

Guards must be implemented directly into the function. Meaning, that if the
function is called, its guards are not checked above the function call, but the
function itself will check the guards. Also guards in the declaration are
meaningless, as they won't be implemented, they only will be implemented, when
used in the definition of the function.

Example:

```
func fac(x : uint32 | x == 0 => 1) : uint32
	return x * fac(x - 1)
;

io.println(fac(10))
```
