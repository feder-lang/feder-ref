## Functions

In Feder functions can have parameters, an optional return-type. Function can
be declared, defined, used as type-values or called. They are declared,
defined or defined-as-type with the keywords 'func' and 'Func'. They are called
with the unary infix operator '()' (between '(' and ')' can be an expression).
