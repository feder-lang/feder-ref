## Operator expressions

Expression without the letters 'a' or 'b' are binary operators at default.
Associativity is either 'l' (=left) or 'r' (=right). An operation can be constant
(='y'), not-constant (='n') or cannot be specified (='-'). The latter are
operations, which can't be used as functions.

depends: If all returned types are constant, the function is also constant.

All operators except assignments, declaration and auto-define are part of
*expr*.  Assignments, declarations and function-calls are part of *stmt*.
