### Break and continue

To control in which order instructions should be executed in
[for](./syntax_conditional_for.md)- or [do](./syntax_conditional_do.md)-loops,
Feder provides the keywords **break** and **continue**.

- **break**: Jump below loop.
- **continue**: Jump to 1 in for-loops or jump to 2 in do-loops.
